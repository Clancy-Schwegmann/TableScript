## Program Summary
 This is a tool that can be used to save a series of numbers to your clipboard, which can then be pasted as an array or spreadsheet!

## How To Use

> Increment to Counter: This is the very top box, so let's say you want to generate a list of numbers from 1 to 100. Well the process is very simple, click on the "starting number" >text box, delete any text that is in the textbox already and enter 1 as your first input, you can then press the "Tab" key on your keyboard to move to the next item. So for >"Increment By" input box we can put 1 because we want to include every whole number from 1 to 100 (this is essentially a step-counter). Lastly, press tab and then type 100 and >then press the "Copy result to clipboard"  button in the box to copy that list of numbers. You should now have numbers 1 through 100 stored in your clipboard and ready to paste >with the Ctrl-V command or your pasting tool of choice.

>Increment to Number: This is the bottom box, similar to "increment to counter" you will want to pick a starting number and amount you want to increment by, but this time around you want to pay attention to the number you are going towards. So let's say you want to go from 8 to 64 and increment by 4 each time. In this case you put in 64 as the final number, Increment by 4, and 8 as the starting number.
